## Getting started

Lets build out a simple welcome email with HEML!

The first thing we'll want to do for our email is add our `<heml>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements. We'll add our style and meta elements in the head, and our content in the body.

```xml
<heml>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</heml>
```

## Our metadata

We'll add a couple of meta elements to start: `<subject>` and `<preview>`. Our subject will appear in the title if the email is viewed in a browser. The preview will show up in certain clients, like Gmail or Apple Mail, which show a snippet of what's inside an email before you open it.

```xml
<!-- inside the head -->
<subject>Email is awesome</subject>
<preview>Learn about all the cool things you can do with email today!</preview>
```


## The layout 

Inside the body, add a basic one column [layout](http://heml.io/docs/elements/layout). This will be 600 pixels wide, or 100% percent of the client, whichever comes first.

```xml
<!-- inside the body -->
<container>
  <row>
    <column></column>
  </row>
</container>
```

## Writing our story ‚úçÔ∏è

Inside of our column, lets create a header and paragraph welcoming the user.

```xml
<!-- inside the column -->
<h1>Hey there! üëã</h1>
<p>Thanks for giving HEML a try! Let us know if you run into any issues or build something awesome with it!</p>
```

Next, lets add another row, this time with three columns. Inside them, we'll explain some fun ways to use email.

```xml
<!-- after the first row, inside the container -->
<row>
  <column>
    <h3>Make games</h3>
    <p>The dynamic duo, Camiah, have made some awesome games in emails!</p>
    <button href="https://codepen.io/reallygoodemails/pen/WGzdXk">Sweep bombs üí£</button>
  </column>
  <column>
    <h3>Show a slideshow</h3>
    <p>Lego sent out an email showing off some of their new sets.</p>
    <button href="https://codepen.io/reallygoodemails/pen/EXdgjY">Check it out üïµ</button>
  </column>
  <column>
    <h3>Win back customers</h3>
    <p>Really Good Emails has collected a series of emails to win you back.</p>
    <button href="https://reallygoodemails.com/category/promotional/winback/">Open your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è</button>
  </column>
</row>
```

Let's also drop in a horizontal rule between our two rows to give them some space.

```xml
...
<!-- in between the two rows -->
<hr>
```


You should have something that looks like this.

## Painting the canvas üé®

Now that we have our email built out, lets make it look good. We'll add some styles so we have a white container and some black buttons.

To do this, we'll add a `<style>` tag to our `<head>` with some CSS.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background: #EEE;
  }

  container {
    background: white;
  }

  hr {
    border-color: #DDD;
  }

  button {
    background: #333;
    padding: 10px 20px;
  }
</style>
```

This all feels a little tight though, so lets add some spacing and make it a bit bigger.

```html
<style>
  container {
    max-width: 700px;
    margin: 10px auto;
    padding: 10px 20px;
  }

  button {
    margin: 10px 0;
  }

  column {
    padding: 0 10px;
  }
</style>
```

And there we go! Our awesome email, ready for the world!
