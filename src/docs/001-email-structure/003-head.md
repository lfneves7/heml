title: Head
---


The `<head>` element holds all metadata about your email, including its [`<subject>`](/docs/elements/meta#subject), [`<style>`](/docs/elements/style), and [`<preview>`](/docs/elements/meta#preview).  It has the same function as the `<head>` tag in HTML. It must be a direct child of the `<heml>` tag and can only be used once.


### Example

```xml
<heml>
  <head>
    <subject>Email Subject</subject>
  </head>
</heml>
```
