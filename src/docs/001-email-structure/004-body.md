title: Body
---

This tag should contain all visible content in your email. Like the `<head>`, there can only be one per document and it must be an direct child of `<heml>`.


### Example

```xml
<heml>
  <head>
    <subject>Email Subject</subject>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</heml>
```
